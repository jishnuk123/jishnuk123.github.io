# My Interests and Goals
![alt text](<vballimage (1).jpg>)

 A few of my main interests — from playing **volleyball**, to studying **data and AI engineering**, and some things I have been working on related to my interests like combining **football** with coding projects.

## Volleyball hello hello ehloo

I’ve been playing **volleyball** for a while now, and it’s one of my favorite ways to stay active and connect with friends.  
I really enjoy playing indoor and love that its fast paced and you get the chance to spike and block. Playing regularly has also helped me improve my **leg strength** and **reaction time** and I have joined intramurals here at UW.

## Studying to Become a Data / AI Engineer   

Over the summer, I took a few **courses in data engineering and artificial intelligence**.  
I worked on projects using:
- **Python** for data analysis and automation  
- **Machine learning basics**, like regression and classification  
- **Databases** and how to handle large datasets  

These courses and videos I watched throughout my summer made me more confident in pursuing a career as a **data or AI engineer**, and I really enjoy building things that can make data more useful and intelligent.

## Projects  

I’ve always loved watching **football**, especially tracking players and game stats like fantasy football. Recently just for fun, I started creating a **fantasy football optimizer** using **Python**.  It’s still a work in progress, but it’s been a fun way to practice coding skills, use real-world sports data, and apply some of what I’ve learned about algorithms and data structures.
